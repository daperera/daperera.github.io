I am a researcher in Machine Learning. In February 2025, I received a PhD in Machine Learning from Télécom Paris university. 

Consciousness is a mystery that lies at the very core of our experience. Yet, it has so far evaded our best efforts to define or measure it. I believe that machine learning is a powerful tool to explore these elusive questions. It provides a way to formulate and quantatively evaluate theories about the inner workings of our mind, the origin of creativity and freedom, the purposes that implicitely drive or thoughts, or the mechanisms that rule the brain -- this intriguiging interface between consciousness and the measurable material world.

During my PhD, I started to study these fascinating issues by focusing on language. Indeed, language articulate our thoughts, and supports the crucial abilities of reasoning, planning and decision. A striking property of language is its discrete nature. It maps observations from our surronding world, which is seemingly continuous, to a finite set of symbols. Our main contribution during this thesis was to leverage Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) to define this mapping, and study its mathematical properties.  

The MCL framework is interesting in itself, and could be used in many areas of machine learning (unsupervised source separation, self-supervised learning, interactive data generation) to solve core issues such as task ambiguity or representation collapse. We are currently exploring these topics, which have various applications such as speech processing, brain signal processing, music editing, or environment tracking.
